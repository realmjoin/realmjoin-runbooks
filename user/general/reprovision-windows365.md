## Offer the license groups as a dropdown

The license group is a text field by default. Offer the license groups of your tenant as a dropdown via runbook customization:

```json
"rjgit-user_general_reprovision-windows365": {
    "Parameters": {
        "licWin365GroupName": {
            "SelectSimple": {
                "lic - Windows 365 Enterprise - 2 vCPU 4 GB 128 GB": "lic - Windows 365 Enterprise - 2 vCPU 4 GB 128 GB",
                "lic - Windows 365 Enterprise - 2 vCPU 4 GB 256 GB": "lic - Windows 365 Enterprise - 2 vCPU 4 GB 256 GB"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
