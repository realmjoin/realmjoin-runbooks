  .SYNOPSIS
  Set up immediate call forwarding for a Microsoft Teams Enterprise Voice user.
  
  .DESCRIPTION
  Set up instant call forwarding for a Microsoft Teams Enterprise Voice user. Forwarding to another Microsoft Teams Enterprise Voice user or to an external phone number.
  
  .NOTES
  Permissions: 
  The connection of the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module is ideally done through the Managed Identity of the Automation account of RealmJoin.
  If this has not yet been set up and the old "Service User" is still stored, the connect is still included for stability reasons. However, it should be switched to Managed Identity as soon as possible.
