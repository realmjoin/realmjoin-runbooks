  .SYNOPSIS
  Get the status quo of a Microsoft Teams user in terms of phone number, if any, and certain Microsoft Teams policies.
  
  .DESCRIPTION
  Get the status quo of a Microsoft Teams user in terms of phone number, if any, and certain Microsoft Teams policies.
  Note: A Microsoft Teams service account must be available and stored - details can be found in the runbook.
  
  .NOTES
  Permissions: 
   The MicrosoftTeams PS module requires to use a "real user account" for some operations.
   This user will need the Azure AD roles: 
    - "Teams Administrator"
    - "Skype for Business Administrator"
   If you want to use this runbook, you will have to
   - Create an ADM-User object, e.g. "ADM-ServiceUser.TeamsAutomation"
   - Assign a password to the user
   - Set the password to never expire (or track the password changes accordingly)
   - Disable MFA for this user / make sure conditional access is not blocking the user
   - Add the following AzureAD roles permanently to the user:
     "Teams Administrator"
     "Skype for Business Administrator"
   - Create a credentials object in the Azure Automation Account you use for the RealmJoin Runbooks, call the credentials "teamsautomation".
   - Store the credentials (username and password) in "teamsautomation".
   This is not a recommended situation and will be fixed as soon as a technical solution is known.
