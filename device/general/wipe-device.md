## Add the device to a compliance exclusion group

When *Add device to compliance exclusion group* (`addToExclusionGroup`) is enabled, the wiped Windows device is added to a compliance exclusion group. Devices in that group receive a longer compliance grace period after they are re-enrolled via Autopilot (this mirrors the **Check Device Onboarding Exclusion** runbook).

By default the group is identified by its **display name** (`exclusionGroupName`). Because display names are not guaranteed to be unique, you can instead pin the group by its **Object ID** (`exclusionGroupId`). When an Object ID is provided, it **always overrides** the display name, so name conflicts can never lead to the wrong group being used. `exclusionGroupId` is hidden by default and is meant to be set via runbook customization.

The group is resolved and validated in an upfront preflight check. If the configured group does not exist, the runbook aborts **before** any wipe/delete/disable action, so no half-applied state is left behind. Adding to the group is skipped for non-Windows devices and when the device is deleted from EntraID (`removeAADDevice`).

### Pin the group by Object ID (recommended)

Preset the group's Object ID and enable the switch, keeping the fields hidden. This avoids any ambiguity from duplicate display names.

The json configuration for this is as follows:

```json
"rjgit-device_general_wipe-device": {
    "parameters": {
        "addToExclusionGroup": {
            "Default": true
        },
        "exclusionGroupId": {
            "Default": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "Hide": true
        },
        "exclusionGroupName": {
            "Hide": true
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with the Object ID of your group (EntraID > Groups > *your group* > **Object Id**).

### Pin the group by display name

If you prefer to work with the display name (and it is unique in your tenant), preset `exclusionGroupName` and leave `exclusionGroupId` empty so the name is used.

The json configuration for this is as follows:

```json
"rjgit-device_general_wipe-device": {
    "parameters": {
        "addToExclusionGroup": {
            "Default": true
        },
        "exclusionGroupName": {
            "Default": "cfg - Intune - Windows - Compliance for unenrolled Autopilot devices (devices)",
            "Hide": true
        }
    }
}
```
