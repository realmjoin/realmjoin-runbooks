# Delete Stale Devices (Scheduled)

Delete Intune devices that have been inactive for too long

## Detailed description
Finds Intune devices that have not checked in for a given number of days, filtered by platform and optionally by the group membership of their primary user. By default it only lists what it would delete; deletion has to be switched on explicitly. The report can be sent by email or provided as a download link.

## Where to find
Org \ Devices \ Delete Stale Devices_Scheduled

## Common use cases

This runbook deletes managed devices from Intune based on inactivity, so use it with care.

- Regular cleanup of stale device records in Intune
- Simulation runs (report-only mode) before enabling the actual deletion
- Scheduled lifecycle management with an audit trail via the email report

## User scope filtering

The runbook supports optional user scope filtering to include or exclude devices based on the group membership of their primary user. This acts as an additional safety net when deletion is enabled.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details on all available settings.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings:

- **Header and footer image** – public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each
- **Footer link** – target of the footer image
- **Accent and text color** – 6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`

When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. An image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or an invalid color value, never prevents the report email – the corresponding default is used instead.
