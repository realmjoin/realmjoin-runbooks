# List Inactive Enterprise Applications

List enterprise applications with no recent sign-ins

## Detailed description
Finds enterprise applications that nobody has signed in to for a given number of days, plus those that were never used, so you can decide whether they are still needed. The check uses the service principal sign-in activity report, which keeps the last sign-in date of every application. Nothing is changed. Needs a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license. The report can be sent by email or provided as a download link.

## Where to find
Org \ Applications \ List Inactive Enterprise Applications

## How the sign-in data is determined

The runbook evaluates the Microsoft Entra **service principal sign-in activity** report
(`/beta/reports/servicePrincipalSignInActivities`). The report holds the date of the last sign-in per
service principal – across delegated and app-only flows, both as client and as resource – and is therefore
not limited to the retention period of the sign-in logs, which keep individual sign-in events for only
7 days (Microsoft Entra ID Free) resp. 30 days (Microsoft Entra ID P1/P2). A threshold of 90 days can
therefore be evaluated as reliably as one of 7 days.

Every enterprise application (service principal) of the tenant is assigned to exactly one of two lists:

- **Inactive applications** – the last sign-in is older than the configured number of days
- **Applications without any sign-in record** – the report contains no sign-in for the application

Requirements:

- A **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2** license – the report is part of *Usage & insights* and is not available without it
- The **AuditLog.Read.All** permission for the report and **Directory.Read.All** for the list of service principals

The runbook only reads data. It does not modify the listed applications.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when a recipient (`EmailTo`) is provided. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details on all available settings.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings:

- **Header and footer image** – public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each
- **Footer link** – target of the footer image
- **Accent and text color** – 6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`

When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. An image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or an invalid color value, never prevents the report email – the corresponding default is used instead.
