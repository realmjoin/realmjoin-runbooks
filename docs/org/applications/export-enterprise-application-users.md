# Export Enterprise Application Users

Export a report of all (enterprise) application owners and users

## Detailed description
This runbook exports a report of enterprise applications (or all service principals) including owners and assigned users or groups.
By default, the generated report files are uploaded to an Azure Storage Account and time-limited download links are returned.
Optionally, the report can be sent via email with CSV and/or Excel (xlsx) attachments.
The ReportFileFormat parameter controls which file formats are generated and delivered (CSV only, CSV & XLSX, or XLSX only).
When the CSV attachment exceeds the email size limit and "CSV & XLSX" is selected, the email falls back to the Excel workbook alone.
