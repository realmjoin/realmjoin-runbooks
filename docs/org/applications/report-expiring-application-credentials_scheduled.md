# Report Expiring Application Credentials (Scheduled)

Report expiring client secrets and certificates of app registrations

## Detailed description
Lists the client secrets and certificates of application registrations with their expiry dates. The list can be limited to credentials that expire within a chosen number of days and to certain applications. The results also appear as tables in the Output Data tab of the run. Nothing is changed. The report can be sent by email or provided as a download link.

## Credential status

Every credential gets a status from the days left until it expires:

- **Expired** - the end date has passed (only listed when all credentials are listed)
- **Critical** - expires within 7 days
- **Warning** - expires within *Days before expiry* when only expiring credentials are listed, within 30 days when all credentials are listed
- **Valid** - expires later than that (only listed when all credentials are listed)

With *List only credentials about to expire*, already expired credentials are left out. *Days before expiry* is not used when all credentials are listed.

## Report delivery

Report files are only generated when a delivery method is selected via the **Report delivery** option (email and/or download link). With *Output Data only* selected, the results are read directly in the Output Data tab of the RealmJoin portal: a summary table plus one table per status (*Expired credentials*, *Critical credentials*, *Warning credentials*, *Valid credentials*), each of which can also be exported to Excel. The report files contain all columns. Email delivery and download link generation are independent and can be combined.

For the download link, the report files are uploaded to the Azure storage account configured in the `RJReport.StorageAccount.*` tenant settings, and time-limited SAS download links are returned. The storage upload authenticates with the Automation account's managed identity; that identity needs the **Storage Account Contributor** RBAC role on the target storage account (this is an Azure RBAC assignment, not a Graph application permission).

When no credential matches the filters, no file is created. If email delivery is selected, the email is still sent, without attachments.

Schedules that were created before the **Report delivery** option existed keep sending their email: a stored recipient alone still enables the email for them. When such a schedule is opened for editing, the option shows *Output Data only*; select the delivery again before saving, otherwise the schedule stops sending the report.

## Setup regarding email sending

Sending an email report is optional and only happens when *Also email the report* or *Also email & download link* is selected as **Report delivery**; a recipient is then required. The sender address is taken from the `RJReport.EmailSender` tenant setting.

This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

See the [RealmJoin Report Settings documentation](https://docs.realmjoin.com/automation/runbooks/runbook-report-settings) for details on all available settings.

### Email branding

The report email honors the optional `RJReport.Branding.*` tenant settings:

- **Header and footer image** - public HTTPS URLs, PNG/JPEG/GIF, max. 200 KB each
- **Footer link** - target of the footer image
- **Accent and text color** - 6-digit hex values, e.g. `#0052cc`

When these settings are not configured, the default RealmJoin graphics and colors are used. An image that cannot be downloaded or validated, or an invalid color value, never prevents the report email - the corresponding default is used instead.
