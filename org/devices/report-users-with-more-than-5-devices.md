## Setup regarding email sending
This runbook sends emails using the Microsoft Graph API. To send emails via Graph API, you need to configure an existing email address in the runbook customization.

This process is described in detail in the [Setup Email Reporting](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-runbooks/tree/master/docs/general/setup-email-reporting.md) documentation.
