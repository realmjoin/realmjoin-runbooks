## Offer the accepted domains as a list

The domain of the new mailbox is free text by default. With a runbook customization the operator picks it from the accepted domains of the tenant instead:

```json
{
        "Runbooks": {
        "rjgit-org_mail_add-shared-mailbox": {
            "ParameterList": [
                {
                    "Name": "DomainName",
                    "Select": {
                        "Options": [
                                {
                                    "Value": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
                                },
                                {
                                    "Value": "contoso.com"
                                }
                            ]
                    },
                    "DefaultValue": "contoso.com"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
