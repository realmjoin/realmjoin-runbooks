.SYNOPSIS
    This script searches for PowerShell scripts within a specified root folder and its subdirectories, and identifies those that are missing corresponding permissions JSON files.

.PARAMETER includedScope
    An array of strings specifying the directory names to include in the search. Default is @("device", "group", "org", "user").

.PARAMETER rootFolder
    The root folder path to start the search. Default is the current location.

.PARAMETER outputPath
    The file path where the list of scripts missing permissions JSON files will be saved.
    If not specified, the list will not be saved to a file and will only be displayed in the console.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script recursively searches through the specified root folder for PowerShell scripts (*.ps1) and checks if they have corresponding permissions JSON files either in the same folder or in a ".permissions" subfolder. If a script is missing its permissions JSON file, its path is added to a list. The list is then saved to the specified output file.

.NOTES
    - The script excludes itself from the search results.
    - The output file is created if it does not exist.
